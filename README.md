# prettify-json
a simple python script that reads in an ugly json file and writes out a prettier formatted copy


# execution

You'll need Python 3.

Run the json-prettify-launcher.cmd script and follow the prompts, or run the python script directly. 

If the json file is in the same directory as the script, simply enter the file name. If the json file is in another directory, enter the full path to the file.

A pretty file should appear in the directory alongside the input file ðŸ˜Š
